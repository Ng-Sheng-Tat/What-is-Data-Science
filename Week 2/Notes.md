## Week 2
- 5V's in **Big Data**
  1. Velocity (data generation is very fast)
  2. Volume (Data is in a big amount)
  3. Variety (Unstructured data)
  4. Veracity (Data accuracy and reliability)
    - attributes, consistency, integrity, completeness, ambiguity
  5. Value (data is turned into informative value)
- uses Hadoop and Apache Spark
---
**Hadoop**
- data input is distributed over a number of servers, and being processed and analyzed simultaneously, and the result is sent back to the servers
- uses probability, statistics, machine learning, hypothesis testing, linear algebra, etc.
---
**Digital Transformation**
- a preliminary steps in transforming data to be processed
- depends on the culture, people, work staff, cost, capability
---
**Data Mining** an automated process that will auto make use of data and provide informative information after processing and analyzing the data.
**Machine Learning** learns from example without being explicitly programmed.
**Deep Learning** using artificial neural network in deep layer to try to mimic human brains in learning algorithm.

**Data Science Key Terms**
**Decision Trees, Bayesian Analysis, Naive Bayes**
**Precision and Recall**
